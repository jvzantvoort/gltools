This tool is created to quickly and easily setup and maintain a
source tree. It's geared towards an Ansible related source tree so
there are some tweaks supporting that (specially when exporting) but
should work on others too.

_Why the whole group?_
 
> A lot of the projects in a group tend to be related and not all
> changes are limited to a single project. Projects can share
> interfaces, logic, etc. but not language or development speed.

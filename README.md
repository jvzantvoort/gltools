# GLTools a gitlab wrapper

This tool is created to quickly and easily setup and maintain a
source tree. It's geared towards an Ansible related source tree so
there are some tweaks supporting that (specially when exporting) but
should work on others too.

I wrote it initialy to help manage some of our ansible environments
at [Proxy B.V.](https://www.proxy.nl/). It allows me to use both
[awx/tower](https://github.com/ansible/awx) (production) and regular
ansible use for development.

# GLTools a gitlab wrapper

This tool is created to quickly and easily setup and maintain a
source tree. It's geared towards an Ansible related source tree so
there are some tweaks supporting that (specially when exporting) but
should work on others too.

I use it at [Proxy B.V.](https://www.proxy.nl/) to manage some of our
ansible environments.
